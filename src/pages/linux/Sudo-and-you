# Whats Sudo

###
Sudo is a way of saying please on Linux operating systems it stands for "superuser do". Similar to when you talk to a family member
If you say please they will be much more inclined to do something. If you want your parents to grab you a glass of water at dinner time
You would say "would you please grab me a glass of water" in Linux you would use sudo if you wanted to grab some files you might say
"sudo wget www.example.com/targetdir/targetfile".

## When should I use sudo? 
###
You will in most cases need to use sudo for most anything like downloading software, running executables or for example updating
your system with "sudo apt-get update". You don't want to use sudo for some simple tasks like making a new directory because then the
directory permissions get funky and can be a security risk if not used correctly. Also if you use sudo your computer will do the task 
so be careful when using commands like "sudo rm*" in the past I've deleted entire directories which I didn't intend to delete.

## What's this talk about su (super user)
###
With this command you can get into other peoples directories and run things that are theirs. if you say "su john456" and enter their 
password you will be in all of Johns stuff. If you type just "su" and enter the root password you will be root I ## NEVER ### recommend
using root I have messed up and deleted more things then I can count using root.

## summary
###
Sudo is similar to saying please in a Unix environment. be careful what you use it for it may mess things up depending on what you use it
with. Using su is a big mess and I personally recommend staying away from it
